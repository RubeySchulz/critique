# critique
daily infinite tier list website

## What is this?
critique is a website to (eventually) rate everything in the world, so you can see where it all lies in a simple concise tier list.
Everyday everyone recieves the same prompt of a random noun on the earth, everyone writes a reviews with a star rating, and the discussion starts.
Compare how you view the world to your friends and strangers, see what everyone's opinion is about everything.

## Where can I use this website?
It is currently in production by just one developer (me) but a beta test is planned to be released soon once it's fully built.

## Why?
I enjoy discussion, I enjoy sharing my opinions with others. I know everyone else feels the same. This is an excuse for a short discussion with your friends
or potential strangers on things you may not think about or consider often. This could perhaps be a reason to connect with your friends everyday which
gets harder to do the older you are. Maybe you just want to argue with strangers about things that don't matter.
